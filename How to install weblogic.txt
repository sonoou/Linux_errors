          WLS Zip Distribution for Oracle WebLogic Server 12.1.3.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE INFORMATION
------------------

WLS Zip Distribution 12.1.3.0 Update 3
July 2015

This WLS Zip Distribution Update contains the complete set of bug fixes from 
Oracle WebLogic Server Patch Set Update 12.1.3.0.4 that will provide benefits to 
the WebLogic development community.  For more information, see the details 
provided at the end of this note.

The WLS zip distribution update is intended for development use only.

INTRODUCTION
------------

The WLS zip distribution is intended for development use. It is supported on 
Windows, Linux and Mac OS X systems. It contains the necessary artifacts to 
develop and test applications on WebLogic Server.  

An optional supplemental zip (wls1213_devzip_supplemental_update3.zip) is 
available as a separate download. The supplemental zip contains samples, 
evaluation database (Derby) and L10N console help files. 

The following instructions should help in quickly setting up WLS. Please refer 
to the general WLS documentation for detailed instructions.

This version of WLS requires JDK 1.7 as a minimum.
Ensure that you have the proper JDK version installed and ready for use.

QUICKSTART
----------

1. Extract the contents of the zip to a directory (eg: /home/myhome/mywls)
   This will create a base directory named wls12130 under /home/myhome/mywls
   MW_HOME will be the entire directory including the base directory. (eg: MW_HOME will be /home/myhome/mywls/wls12130).

2. Setup JAVA_HOME and optionally, MW_HOME variables in the current shell as required
   for the target platform.

  Linux
    $ export JAVA_HOME=/home/myhome/myjavahome
    $ export MW_HOME=/home/myhome/mywls/wls12130

  Mac
    $ export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.7.0.jdk/Contents/Home
    $ export USER_MEM_ARGS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"       
    $ export MW_HOME=/home/myhome/mywls/wls12130

  Windows
    > set JAVA_HOME=C:\home\myhome\myjavahome
    > set MW_HOME=C:\home\myhome\mywls\wls12130


3. Run the installation configuration script in the MW_HOME directory.
   
  This step is required to be run only once. If you move the installation to 
  another location/machine, you need to rerun this step.

  Linux/Mac
    $ . ./configure.sh 

  Windows
    > configure.cmd
    
  To run the installation configuration in silent mode.
  
  Linux/Mac
    $. ./configure.sh -silent
  
  Windows
    > configure.cmd -silent
    
  Exit status of zero means the script was successful.

  On Windows, this step retains the WLS environment settings for the current shell. 
  So, the next step can be omitted.

4. Setup WLS environment in the current shell. 

   Linux
    $ . $MW_HOME/wlserver/server/bin/setWLSEnv.sh 

   Mac
    $ . $MW_HOME/wlserver/server/bin/setWLSEnv.sh 

   Windows
    > %MW_HOME%\wlserver\server\bin\setWLSEnv.cmd

5. Create a new WLS domain and start WLS.
   
   It is recommended that you create domains outside the MW_HOME.

   Linux
    $ mkdir /home/myhome/mydomain
    $ cd /home/myhome/mydomain
    $ $JAVA_HOME/bin/java $JAVA_OPTIONS -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m weblogic.Server
    
   Mac
    $ mkdir /home/myhome/mydomain
    $ cd /home/myhome/mydomain
    $ $JAVA_HOME/bin/java $JAVA_OPTIONS -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m weblogic.Server	
			
   Windows
    > mkdir C:\home\myhome\mydomain
    > cd C:\home\myhome\mydomain
    > %JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe %JAVA_OPTIONS% -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m weblogic.Server

   Once the domain is created, you can shutdown WLS and restart it with the 
   scripts provided in the newly created domain. 
   
   Note: You can also create the domain by invoking the GUI configuration
   wizard (Run MW_HOME/wlserver/common/bin/config.[sh|cmd]).

6. If you already have an existing domain that you want to run with this 
   installation, edit the DOMAIN_HOME/bin/setDomainEnv.sh script and change the 
   WL_HOME to point to the new installation - ${MW_HOME}/wlserver/

   Note: If the existing domain has samples configured, the server will issue
   failures during startup as samples are not included in the zip distribution.

7. Start a browser and open up url - 'http://localhost:7001/console' to 
   administer the server.
 
8. If you need samples, evaluation database (Derby) or console help files for
   for non-english locales, you can download the supplemental zip and extract 
   it under MW_HOME. Follow instructions in README_SUPP.txt to properly setup
   samples.

WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED
--------------------
The following components are not available in the zip distribution.

# Native JNI libraries for unsupported platforms
# Samples, evaluation database (Derby), non-english console help
  (can be added by using the WLS supplemental zip)
# WebServices clients have been moved to the WLS supplemental zip
# OPatch in not included in the ZIP installation
# OCM is not included in the ZIP installation

CLEANUP
-------
Delete the MW_HOME directory. Note that this will delete everything under
MW_HOME. If you have created domains or extracted supplemental zip those 
files will be removed as well. Ensure that you don't create domains or 
applications under MW_HOME directory for easier migration. 

UPGRADE
-------
In-place upgrade of installation is not supported in the zip distribution. 
Download the new version of zip distribution and extract it to a new location. 
Change the MW_HOME to point to the new location and update the startup scripts
in your domains to point to the new MW_HOME.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
# [MAC OS X] Memory settings have to be explicitly defined using the 
  USER_MEM_ARGS variable prior to running any domain scripts.
# [MAC OS X] The config wizard does not recognize a Mac OS X JDK installation 
  and issues a warning. But, it successfully creates a domain and should not 
  cause any issue running servers in the domain.
# [MAC OS X] The zip distribution has limited support for functionality 
  requiring native support. JMS C clients, auto stack-dumps, auto privileged 
  port binding are not supported.
# [ALL OS] Smart update tool is not supported in a zip distribution.
# [ALL OS] The zip distribution should not be extracted to an existing MW_HOME
  or BEA_HOME which had been created by a regular installers. Doing so will
  conflict with already installed products and is unsupported.

PATCHING
--------
# Installations based on the WebLogic Zip Distribution cannot be patched. If
 you require a patch, you must install WebLogic using a full distribution, and
 then use OPatch to apply the required patch.
