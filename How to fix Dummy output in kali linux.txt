How to fix Dummy output in kali linux

Method 1:(If doesn't work, Follow 2nd Method)

	     open terminal as root user
	   	 type "cd /etc/default/" hit enter
	     type "ls" hit enter
	     there is "grub" file you need to edit with any editor
	     so i am gonna use mousepad editor
	     type "mousepad grub" hit enter
	     and you have to find GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet" and
	     change to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet snd_hda_intel.dmic_delect=0"
   	     once changes are made save and close the mousepad editor
	     then type command "update-grub" and it will take a bit time
	     when it will be done reboot your system and see the changes

Method 2:(If Doesn't work, Follow 3rd Method)

	     Reference( https://www.kali.org/docs/troubleshooting/no-sound/ )
	     Kali linux version 2022.3 & 2022.4(installed)
	     type "apt list --installed | grep pipewire-pulse" hit enter
	     If you get output like:
	         WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.
	  
	         pipewire-pulse/kali-rolling,now 0.3.62-1 amd64 [installed,automatic]
	      
	     then type "apt purge --autoremove pipewire-pulse ; reboot" hit enter
	     it perfectly worked in my case

Method 3:(If This doesn't work too then find solution on internet)
         
         open terminal as root user
         type "apt install pipewire-pulse" hit enter
         type "reboot" hit enter
