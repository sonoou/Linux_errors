Amazon Clone Project
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, JSP, MySQL, AJAX, JSON

Developed a fully functional Amazon clone with a focus on e-commerce features such as product browsing, user authentication, and order management. The front-end was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive design across devices. For the back-end, I used Java and JSP to handle server-side logic and MySQL for database management, storing user data, product information, and order history. AJAX and JSON were employed for asynchronous data fetching and real-time updates, providing a smooth user experience. The project helped me improve my full-stack development skills, combining front-end and back-end technologies to create a dynamic e-commerce platform.
