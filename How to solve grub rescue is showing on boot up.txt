How to solve grub rescue is showing on boot up

type "ls" this will output like
(hd0) (hd0,gpt1) OR (hd1) (hd1,gpt1) OR both 
The No. of disks and partitions depend on 
how many disk you have and how many partition in that
Now you have to check in which partition have "Filesystem is ext2"
type "ls (hd[0 to n],gpt[0 to n])" hit enter
Repeat above command unless you got output: Filesystem is ext2
Now type "set boot=(hd[no.],gpt[no.])" 
                        \        /
                         \      /
                          \    /
                           \  /
                            \/
               That partition no. which shows
                    "Filesystem is ext2"
type "set prefix=(hd[same above],gpt[same above])/boot/grub" hit enter
type "insmod normal" hit enter
type "normal" hit enter
once linux is started open terminal as root user
type "update-grub" enter
type "grub-install /dev/sda" enter

if you got error like "grub-install: error: /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/modinfo.sh doesn't exist. Please specify --target or --directory."

then first "apt install grub-efi"
then "grub-install /dev/sda"
