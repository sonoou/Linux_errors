How to solve "Windows boot img is not showing in kali linux boot menu"

open terminal as root user
type "cd /etc/default/" hit enter
type "ls" hit enter
there is "grub" file you need to edit with any editor
so i am gonna use mousepad editor
type "mousepad grub" hit enter
to showing wondows boot img you need to add this line in grub file
"GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false" without quotation mark
after changes are made save the file and close
and type command "update-grub" and it will take a bit time
when it will be done reboot your Linux and see the changes
