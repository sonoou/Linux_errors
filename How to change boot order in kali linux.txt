open terminal as root user
type "cd /etc/default/" hit enter
type "ls" hit enter
there is "grub" file you need to edit with any editor
so i am gonna use mousepad editor
type "mousepad grub" hit enter
you will see a "GRUB_DEFAULT=0" 0 for kali linux and 2 for windows 
after changing the value 0 or 2 save and close
and type command "update-grub" and it will take a bit time
when it will done restart and see the changes
