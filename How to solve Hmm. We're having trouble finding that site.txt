How to solve "Hmm. We're having trouble finding that site"

open terminal as root
type "cd /etc/" hit enter
type "ls" hit enter
where you will see "resolv.conf" file
remove it and make new one with the name resolv.conf using nano text editor otherwise it will not work
type "nano resolv.conf" ( make sure you are in "/etc" directory )
nano editor will be open with new file name "resolv.conf"
in this file you have to write "nameserver 8.8.8.8"
and press "ctrl+o" to save and hit enter and then press "ctrl+x" to exit from editor
